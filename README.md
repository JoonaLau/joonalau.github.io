# Web Development Fundamentals Project

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of fundamental web development concepts, including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The goal is to build a personal website from scratch, with the possibility of using it as a portfolio page for future job applications.

## Project Objectives

- **Skill Development:** Acquiring practical skills in web development with a focus on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
- **Portfolio Creation:** Crafting a personal website that may later function as a professional portfolio.
- **Learning by Doing:** Gaining practical experience by working on a real-world project from the ground up.

## Why This Project?

I decided to start this project alongside completing "Full Stack Open" course by University of Helsinki.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Project Structure:**
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
   - `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity.

2. **Development Steps:**
   - The development process involves continuous learning and improvement.

## Future Plans

As the project progresses, it may evolve into a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my projects, skills, and experiences.
